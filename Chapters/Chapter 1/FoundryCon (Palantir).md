## Dr. Carp and Matt Babin

- Palantir started with data protection agencies
	- Dr. Carp is a doctor in German Linguistics
	- Involved in finding terrorists
	- Involved in supplying software to USA, NATO, and Ukraine
	- Recently created a division in energy and oil
	- Builds products, often, before they are useful 
	- Contradiction:
		- Incumbent but always advancing
		- Engineering organization that works with non-engineering orgs. 

Foundry is social yet not social; has "civil liberties protection" which restricts data to prevent a data lake for individuals. Building a culture in a company starts with data to make decisions. 

Previously Silicon Valley was Enterprise -> Civilian,  now it focuses on turning customers to products

- What are the ethics around AI?
	- Huge ethical dilemma. 
	- If AI generates battleplans, and it fails, who is held responsible?
	- Unknown inputs into AI creates unknown outputs. 
		- Should be able to explain AI to regulations and how it made it decisions. 
- Everyone wants results, but results must come from context from a platform that takes time to build

### Summary
Overall, Dr. Carp built Palantir to work with Data, primarily working with militaries around the Western World to create production solutions to fight terrorism both on the ground and in the internet. Palantir continues to build software into the future, pushing the envelop in ways that include building software before it's needed. It has a big focus on stopping terrorism while also not eliminating the data protection that we have. Palantir builds AI a lot, even before it was generative, but also looks beyond to build solutions in AI so that an organization can have better results while still knowing where the inputs are coming from, a key fact in being able to work with regulators in how AI is making decisions. As if AI makes decisions, it can become difficult to see who is actually responsible for the decisions, such as the ethical dilemma of an AI sending troops on a failed battleplan. It's important that we continue pushing the bounds of software to create a better world with privacy and protection.

## Shyam Sanker
Chief Technology Officer

- Connecting a business is crucial
	- Without it, a business becomes inflexible and entrenches themselves
		- People trust themselves, employees escape from the data (move to excel or their head)
	- Ontology allows you to mine the data of your business
	- Business should be computable

Ontology Web Services
- Allows us to understand the actions/logic behind complex companies
	- Have the output of a model compute to building block actions 
- See the process between all sorts of different applications
	- He uses OWS to make a truck with a heavy load + worn engine to create a maintenance ticket automatically 

### Summary
Syam Sanker used Ontology to showcase how you can create a better business by using the data that a business has ("Mining the Data"). He showcased how foundry can be integrated into all sorts of software, allowing you to simplify models that were once separated between all sorts of software's using Actions and Automations. All of this was done to centralize business logic allowing it to be the SDK of a business. This allows a business to respond to reality in real time. 

## Deborah Birx
Brand Ambassador
*The way she wears her watch is driving me crazy*

- Talks about COVID and Pandemics, and using data to combat misinformation
- Political Matters, Will, must used data to allow people to move pass their own assumption
- Ukraine changed how they handled HIV to use a data-focused to see communities that were underserved, saw a decline in HIV infections
- Talked about their work in Africa to find how to better treat patients with HIV, and finding that they were losing 6 patients for every 1 gained. Mainly affected young and men. 
- Talked about COVID-19 and found that children and adults were underrepresented. 
	- Used data to create graphics for counties and governors across the country

### Summary
Data is something that is extremely important when you want to handle a pandemic, helping communities get the information they need to make informed decisions. Palantir helped with that by helping compile information together so analysis could be made, both when working in Africa and in the United States during both of their pandemics.

## Bernardo Rodriguez
Chief Digital and Technology Officer (JD Power)

- ~25s, a Ford F150 comes off the assembly line
- Lots of factors go into selling a car:
	- Inventory
		- What types of cars do you buy to sell in an area?
		- 3x faster to sell a house than a car
		- $150 Billion in assets just waiting to be sold 
	- Incentive Spending
		- How to get customers incentive to buy the product
		- $25 Billion in US incentive (60B+ a few years ago)
		- Incentives x values x regions x models

JD power Datasets:
- Inventory, Configurations, Residual, Available Incentives, Sales, Price, Margins, Incentives, Buyers, repairs, vehicle values, quality, experience ratings, loyalty
	- Used to build an ontology in Palantir to mind data
		- Can give customers alerts when/how there are problems with market share relative to competitors
- OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer)

### Summary
Collecting data is extremely important, allowing you to gain insight into how the market is moving. However, raw data is outdated data, data needs to be mined. In this presentation, Bernardo goes over how JD Power uses the data it collects to inform dealers and manufacturers about market changes happening around the country. He uses Denver as an example, where you can see alerts being sent out because Ford does not have the vehicle models to compete with the Silverado in that local market. In the future, JD wants to build predictions :)

## Todd Inlander
SVP & Chief Information Officer of Southern California Edison
(Previously Space Engineer at NASA)

- Southern California Edison is a public utility
	- Heavy regulated industry
	- Long decision making process
	- Largest whether Prediction Model in all of California 
		- Used to mitigate fires

- Leverage data to decide where to cut power 
	- Bad data leads to problems and possibly lives
	- Goes from people centric to workflow centric
	- Workflows allows easier and better data mining
		- Built using Ontology
			- Built using 3 months
			- Allows better leveraging of data

- Ultimately, Foundry is used to create a better experience for customers 
	- Ensures notifications go to the right people (60% reduction in missed customer notifications)
	- Can be used to meet regulators requirements

### Summary
Todd Inlander and Southern California Edison built out a data solution using Palantir Ontology in order to build data that is better for customers. This has allowed them to fully transition to Palantir in December 2021 and has allowed more accurate data keeping as all data is kept in one central location, with workflows available to send notifications where there are wildfires. This transition has helped connect the business together, moving from hardware to software in reporting. This connectiveness allowed them to move away from a person oriented to a workflow oriented information business. 

## Marc Rouanne
Executive Vice President & Chief Network Officers at DISH

- 4G is highly complex and static
	- Outdated infrastructure, custom integrations to work with this infrastructure
- Traditional offering are monolithic
	- One size can't fit all, too slow to keep up with modern enterprises

Creating a simplier network of hardwares allowing different apis to easily hook into each other. Don't need to worry about VPNS, different carriers, sim card versions, or anything else. It just connects like *boom boom*. 

### Summary
5G is being built for machines, allowing data to be sent anywhere at a moments notice. This allows businesses to get data anywhere at anytime, into a central data to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Enterprise networks allow businesses more flexibility in getting their data. 

*this felt the weakest presentation so far, like, I get 5G is very important allowing data to get sent from anywhere, but it felt like it took a while for Marc to get to that idea, and when he does, it feels more like a buzzword than actual key idea. He also goes between big, high level where you don't need specialized knowledge into low level, technical knowledge.*

## Paul DiGiovanni
Founder & CEO Integrity Tool and Mold

They create 600 moles for over 50 clients. 
Used Palantir to streamline the process of creating the processes that are needed when manufacturing custom molds, from customer invoices to all the specific parts that needs to be printed.

### Summary
Definitely a very short presentation, however, it shows that streamlining processes using data allows businesses to create a better workflow that everyone can keep track of the specific moving parts.

## John Birch & Devon Yates
Senior Manager, Data Strategy & Programs at PG&E
Principal Data Scientist PG&E

Public Safety Power Shut-Off (PSPS)

Pacific Gas & Electric
- Handled PSPS using Excel, difficult to estimate where (and how many) shutdowns would occur
- PSPS wasn't enough, had to gather more data in a central location to data mine in how to prevent fires
	- 99% reduction in acreage burned in 2022
	- Was able to use Foundry to get to a MVP sooner by offloading the front end. 

### Summary
PG&E used Palantir to centralize the data they had in order to keep all departments on the same page, from the meteorology predictions to the risk assortment departments, they all used the same data to make decisions. This allows the company to act fast and effectively, helping to mitigate areas at most high risk while being able to accurately help stop forest fires in their tracks. 

## Brian Hammond
Chief Technology Officer at Tampa General Hospital

- Previously had data locked off from the rest of the team; culminated in data sprawl and duplicate data. 
	- Were information poor when starting to think of solutions
- Insights are great; but without action they are useless

### Summary
Centralizing data can help keep everyone on the same page, but it also helps from same day planning to planning for the future. Tampa General Hospital centralized its data into one spot that allows information to be easily access and actions to be taken, such as planning staff days in advance instead of just hours. This allowed the company to go from information poor, where all information was all over the place, to information rich allowing them to move quickly and with purpose.
