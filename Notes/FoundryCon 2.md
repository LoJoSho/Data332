- When you efficantly use your money, you can disrupt opponents
- "Formativative" to better and help transform the world
	- Building software to make institutions work
- It's important for the West to ensure at least parity with technology with rivals
- America need to diversify high value enterprises outside of influence points (ie Silicon Valley)
- Theory -> Practice -> Honesty
- You don't have to answer questions, don't lie. 

### Summary
Palantir tries to follow Silicon Valley 1.0 where they build for the government before heading to the consumer market. In this way, Palantir is always looking to transform the world with their software solutions and building software that helps everyone in the process. In this way, Palantir continues to fight for honesty in the workplaces, because without it, it can be difficult to bring teams together. 

## Shyam Sanker
COO at Palantir

- The world always assumed you need a better plan
	- But plans != operations
- Building software to ensure things continue to flow
- Integration suppliers and consumers

### Summary
Palantir building software before companies need it, allowing their customers to use their software to quickly build new products based on the data they already have. This includes predictions of for the military, how to better utilize the supply chain, and how one could distribute PPE during a global pandemic. 

## John Rickermann
(Managing Director at Jacobs)

- Fortune 500 Engineering Company
	- Water operations expertise
	- Accelerates nature process to process water 
- Each plant is different; need to be able to get data from tons of sources
- How to push results so people in the field get the data?
	- Tablets, Where employees are and what they should do
- Saving $300,000 on just one plant
- Good data leads to a company being proactive in problem solver

### Summary
Water is a difficult job, and there are a lot of variables. As such, it can be difficult to optimize while also meeting legal requirements. Furthermore, all plants are different, leading to implementations per site rather than nationwide. As such, it's vital to bring data into all one place from many different architectures. It's imperative to bring data into one place to analyze to make informed decisions, and then use that data in ways that allow anyone to understand (and to know what to do with that data)

## James Boustead
(Global Head of Legal, compliance, & Government Technology at Morgan Stanley)

- Financial crime is a data problem
	- Need to know everything about a client, in one place
	- Palantir is an API driven, allowing easily integration
- Talks about how dealing with dashboard data to a new service
	- Gothem to Palantir 
- Apollo had problems with legal requirements, had to work around until it was all fixed

### Summary
Morgan Stanley was running an old version of Gotham to help crack down on Financial crime. However, it was growing outdated and so needed to move. To do this, they needed to move to Palantir, however, they must also continue to meet legal requirements. They can't just take everything down and move it. So, they worked closely with partners to ensure a solution was made that fixed everyone's problems. 

## Jennifer Krolikowski
U.S. Space Systems Command (CIO)

- No slides or excel!
-  Partnerships > Contracts
- Disparate data can be compiled to make a better decision
	- COVID per area can help predict how ready air force readyness
- Data prepares battle fields to happen
	- Logistics wins wars
## Summary
Coronel Kolakowski combines data to make better decisions for the government. She went from a 800 million dollar overrun of a budget to be able to condense data for less than a million a year. This has allowed a synergy to exist in the department, from knowing how COVID was affecting readiness in American airbases to being able to evacuate individuals from Afghanistan by tracking where resources were flowing, she has built decisions on data making things go faster. 

## Travis Osbone
VP Information Technology Apache

- Being safe, being efficient, and being profitable
- What data comes in for what purpose?
- Well360
	- Bringing data from wells in house
	- Brought data from being annually/monthly to daily. 
		- Able to predict emissions
		- What design principles can be put into place going forward?
- Make Results visible
- Build use case momentum and confidence
- Socialize platform power to stakeholders
- Be ready for tough news from getting the data

### Summary
Real-time data allows reports to be made on the fly, and decisions as well. If there is a oil well malfunctioning, you don't need to wait until a tech checks on it, you can see it right from the office. This allows businesses to build safely, be efficient in their operations, which all leads to a company being more profitable. 

## Jeff Shilling
National Cancer Institute

- Federal Agency that focuses on rare cancers
- Data is collected from many systems, most not operated by the NCI
- Data helps:
	- Understand portfolio of research being funded
	- Pipelines for scientific data analysis
		- Helps validate data by using the same pipeline
- Medical software is often not made to be compatible
	- Data needs to be cleaned/tidied to be compatible between systems

### Summary
Cancer is a disease that's can be hyper unique to individuals and as such, it needs to be researched to develop effective curses. To do this, lots of data needs to be pooled together from numerus systems that allows doctors to perform analysis to make the best judgements for the patients. It also helps on a more organizational level, allowing leaders to see how money is being spent and the impact that each study is having. 

## Scott Spradley
CTO at Tyson Foods

- What happens when you have no data to get...
- Being able to produce results quickly allows companies to transform
- Only 46% of truck routes were full when they set out
	- Now they are 80% of all routes full
- Able to figure out where inventory is to prevent products from going bad

### Summary
At Tyson foods, they were a bit behind the technological curve. Unlike many companies, they didn't even have a datalake to take data in. As such, they took massive leaps to ensure that they modernize their supply chain, allowing the company to transform quickly. By having this data at their fingertips, it allows them to optimize quickly, such as making trucks much more optimize in their cargo hulls. It's through transformation that people see the value in data that helps efficiently optimize a company.
