# Introduction to Systems Analysis & Design
## System Development Life Cycle
### Why do we need it?
- Failures occur too often
- Development is not intuitive
- Projects get late, over budget, and under delivered
#### System Analyst
- Design a system to add value

Planning -> Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Repeat

### Planning Phase
- Why should we build it?
- What value does it add?
- How long will it take?

1. Project Initiation
	- Develop/Receive a system request
	-  Conduct feasibility analysis
2. Project Management
	-  Develop the work plan
	-  Staff the project
	-  Monitor and control the project
		- Gantt Charts

### Analysis Phase
- Who will use it?
- What should the system do for us?
- Where & when will it be used?

1. Develop an Analysis Strategy
	- Model the current system
	- Formulate the new system
2. Gather the requirements
	- Develop a system Concept
	- Create business model to show data and processes
3. Develop a system proposal

### Design Phase
- How should we build it?

1. Develop a design strategy
2. Design architecture and interfaces
3. Develop databases and file specifications
4. Develop the program design to specify what each programs do

### Implementation Phase

1. Construct the system
2. Install system
3. Support system


## Methodologies
- A formalized approach to implementing SDLC
- Categories
	- Process oriented
	- Data oriented
	- Object oriented
	- Structured
		- Waterfall development
			- "Cascading series of things entirely from start to finish"
			- Requirements -> Design -> Devleopment -> Testing -> Development -> Maintainence
		- Parallel development
	- Rapid action development
		- Phased
		- Prototyping
	- Agile development
		- Scrum
		- eXtreme programming

### Specific to Data Analytics
#### CRISP-DM

1. Business understanding
2. Data understanding
3. Data preparation
4. Model building
5. Testing and evaluation
6. Deployment

### Considerations

- Data source reliability
- Data content accuracy
- Data accessibility
- Data security and data privacy
- Data richness
- Data consistency
- Data currency
- Data granularity
- Data validity and relevancy
