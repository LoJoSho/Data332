- ETL 
	- Extract Transform Load
- ELT
	- Extract Load Transform

- Team roles and skill sets
- Object-oriented systems characteristics
- Object-oriented systems analysis & design
- The unified process and its extensions
- The unified modeling language (UML)

- Why do we need a formal process?
	- Failures occur (too) often
	- Creating systems is not intuitive
	- Projects are late, over budget, or delivered with fewer features than planned
- System Analyst is a key person
	- Designs a system to add value
	- Understand the business processes
	- Job is rewarding yet challenging
	- Require specific skill sets

SDLC 
- Planning
	- Why should we build this system? What value does it bring?
	- Project Initiation
		- Develop/receive a system request
		- Conduct feasibility analysis - *Often isn't used anymore in software*
	- Project Management
		- Develop the work plan. Staff project. Monitor & control the project. 
- Analysis
	- Who will use it? Where & when will it be used
	- Develop Analysis Strategy
		- Model current system, Formulate new system
	- Gather Requirements
		- Develop a system concept. Create a business model to represent.
	- Develop system proposal
- Design
	- How should we build it?
		- Develop databases and file specifications
		- Develop a strategy
		- Design architecture
- Implementation (Repeat)
	- Construct the system
		- Build it (write the code)
	- Install system
		- Train users
	- Support system
