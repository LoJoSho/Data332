Joins allow you to combine two databases, with it only keeping the overlapping data (depending on your options). So for example...

### Left Join
Left Join combines the Left Table and the overlap between Left and right Table

### Right Join
Same as left join, but for the right database

### Inner Join
Inner join only returns the overlap between the two tables. If a key is in the left but isn't in the right, it won't show that data. 

### Full Join
This makes it so all data is available, even if it's exclusive to one table or is shared between the two.
